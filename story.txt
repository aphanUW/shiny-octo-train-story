    "Attention all passengers of the Orcadian: we have received word of a
peculiar situation. A shiny octopus has been found on this train. Please do
not be alarmed for the creature will not harm you. If you see this creature we
urge you to report your sighting to an immediate staff member. We apologize
for this inconvenience and hope your remaining stay on the Orcadian is free
of trouble."

An octopus on a train? And a shiny one at that. Preposterous! We are on a train
nowhere near the ocean and how could an octopus even manage to get into a train?
As a contemplated to myself upon hearing such a baffling announcement, I looked
around surveying the other passengers. A group of men chuckled to themselves at
the idea of an octupus running about on a train, a grandmother seemed perturbed
as her grandson was asking what an octopus was, and a worker scanned the room
annoyed. What could be done I thought to myself. Finding the atmosphere a tad
uncomfortable, I left my seat to get a drink.

A shiny octopus? How silly I continued to think to myself. Upon entering the
bar car, I found no one to be there. Seems nobody wanted to drink with an
octopus I chuckled to myself. As that thought ended in my mind, a faint glimmer
behind the bar caught my eye. Curious, I walked towards the glimmer to be met
with a surprise. There it was: a shiny octopus.
